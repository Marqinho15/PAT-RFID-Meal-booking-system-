# PAT-RFID-Meal-booking-system-
Course final evaluation project. 
This project let the people of a school to see the menu and book meals online and validating them with a rfid card.

For this project I have learned SQL, PHP, VB, HTML by myself during the school time, because even if some languages were teached, like VB, that only happened after I've used it on this project.

The website hosting was done in localhost using the wampserver package.

The website was developed using mySQL, PHP and HTML.
In the admin side it lets registering new users and new staff. And register the weekly menu.
In the website frontend we could login, change password, see history, book meals and manage the meals booked with some rules like having a deadline to book the meals and having a maximum of absences from scheduled meals before getting stopped of booking future meals.

The in-school validation was done by a rfid card with a rfid reader that communicates with a VB program.
When a rfid card is read the vb program that was connected with the database shows the rfid card owner id and if he has a meal booked for the day.

The database was developed in mySQL and used phpmyadmin to handle the administration of all database.
